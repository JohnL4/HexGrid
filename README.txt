This is some code to display a grid of hexagons.  I hope to use it as
the basis for a variety of hex-based things (mostly games, starting
with GURPS combat).  The earlier version (check the commit comments)
was junk, but this one is a better base on which to work.

Improvements are forthcoming; this is mainly a big checkpoint because
I finally got the first pass working and I wanted to commit before
continuing work (and breaking it all).
